        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>As a kid I have always loved videogames and my dream was to become a game developer one day. I have always
            had a deep fascination about how things are made.
            I remember as a kid playing on my nintendo DS asking to myself "How did they make the water look like that",
            "How did they animate that enemy" and with the explosion that was the procedural generated games like
            Minecraft, the big question of "how can you create infinite worlds?"</p>
        <p>Because of those burning questions and a desire to create, I joined the degree of game development and design
            in the
            <a href="http://https://www.udg.edu/es/coneix/la-udg">University of Girona</a> where I learned to program
            and create software aplications. I
            started using Unity3D 2
            years in my
            degree and have developed a fair share of prototypes: a <a href=""> 2D
                platformer</a> ,
            a <a href="">serious game</a> and even an <a href="">atmospheric Horror Game</a>.
            There I also discovered Blender3D which I used to create a wide variety of 3D enviroments and characters.
        </p>
        <p>This last years I have shifted my focus to web development and data analysis thanks to the oportunity I've
            had working at <a href="https://www.endesa.com/">Endesa</a>. I enjoy the workflow that comes with web
            development and the freedom it provides when it comes to my artistical view as well as the ability to create
            smaller projects and designs.</p>
