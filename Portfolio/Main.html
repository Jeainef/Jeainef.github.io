                    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
                    <p>As a kid I have always loved videogames and my dream was to become a game developer one day. I
                        have
                        always
                        had a deep fascination about how things are made.
                        I remember as a kid playing on my nintendo DS asking to myself "How did they make the water look
                        like
                        that",
                        "How did they animate that enemy" and with the explosion that was the procedural generated games
                        like
                        Minecraft, the big question of "how can you create infinite worlds?"</p>
                    <p>Because of those burning questions and a desire to create, I joined the degree of game
                        development
                        and
                        design
                        in the
                        <a href="http://https://www.udg.edu/es/coneix/la-udg">University of Girona</a> where I learned
                        to
                        program
                        and create software aplications. I
                        started using Unity3D 2
                        years in my
                        degree and have developed a fair share of prototypes: a <a href=""> 2D
                            platformer</a> ,
                        a <a href="">serious game</a> and even an <a href="">atmospheric Horror Game</a>.
                        There I also discovered Blender3D which I used to create a wide variety of 3D enviroments and
                        characters.
                    </p>
                    <p>This last years I have shifted my focus to web development and data analysis thanks to the
                        oportunity
                        I've
                        had working at <a href="https://www.endesa.com/">Endesa</a>. I enjoy the workflow that comes
                        with
                        web
                        development and the freedom it provides when it comes to my artistical view as well as the
                        ability
                        to
                        create
                        smaller projects and designs.</p>
